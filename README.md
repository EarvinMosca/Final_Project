# Final_Project
Final Project for PIC 10C

Program runs blackjack game using C++ and Qt.
The program uses code and logic similar to Assignment 1, but implements Qt to add a GUI component to the game.
Thus, from the course:
-GitHub used for version control.(Although couldn't figure out how to do it within Qt so simply used GitHub desktop to move files)
-Inheritance & Polymorphism: Used mainly from the fact that Qt inherently uses inheritance for it's implementation of ui, which follows in accordance to the paradigm of polymorphism.
-Qt: Used mainly to create the graphics of the game as well as prompter for human input. Used sliders to set betting value.
